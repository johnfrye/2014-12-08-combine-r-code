=========================

This repository contains scripts, data, and exercise solutions for the shell and R sessions from the [Scientific computing for the Life Sciences using R and Studio Software Carpentry workshop](http://resbaz.github.io/2014-12-08-combine-r/) held at the University of Melbourne on the 8th and 9th of December, 2014.

All data under the `nelle/` directory comes directly from the [Software Carpentry](software-carpentry.org) repository at [bc/tree/gh-pages/novice/shell/filesystem/users/nelle](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/tree/gh-pages/novice/shell/filesystem/users/nelle).

The gapminder data used in the R lessons comes from the Software Carpentry workshop run by Diego Barneche at the University of Sydney in October 2014 ([website](http://dbarneche.github.io/2014-10-31-USyd/))([repository](https://github.com/dbarneche/2014-10-31-USyd/)).

All R scripts under `R-scripts/`, and shell scripts under `nelle/exercises*` were written by Scott Ritchie during the live-coding portion of the workshops.
